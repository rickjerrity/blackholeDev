          My name is Nick and I code the things. I&apos;m a full-time .NET software developer and I work on weird projects in my spare time that I
          write posts about here. I love listening to music, watching Twitch, playing videogames, and keeping up with new electronics and tech.
          I&apos;ve been printed in the <a href="https://2600.com/">2600 magazine</a> (Autumn 2007 issue) and I founded/hosted one of the largest
          conferences in the world dedicated completely to telephone hacking (phreaking) (ConfCon 2009/2010).

          I really like JavaScript, Python, and C#, and I focus on web/mobile development. I&apos;m a full-stack developer familiar with working on
          small teams and bringing features from concept to production. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/rickjerrity">GitHub</a> for some code
          examples.
